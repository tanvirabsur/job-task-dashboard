🧪 Frontend Developer Test – Zettabyte Technology Inc.
Thank you for applying to join Zettabyte Technology Inc.
Due to the large number of applications, we are running an initial screening project.
You will have 3 days to complete this task.
________________________________________
🎯 Objective
Build a mini dashboard using Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.
This test is UI-focused.
We want to evaluate how you:
•	Structure and reuse components
•	Handle API data with hooks and state
•	Add meaningful animations
•	Maintain clean, consistent, and scalable code
👉 You do not need to solve algorithm-style problems here.
________________________________________
🛠 Requirements
1. Framework & Setup
•	Use Next.js 15 (App Router) with TypeScript.
•	❌ Do not use shadcn/ui or other component libraries. Use only Tailwind CSS and your own custom components.
•	Use Framer Motion for animations.
________________________________________
2. Pages / Routes
•	/ → Dashboard Home
o	Show a static summary section (e.g., welcome text, placeholder stats).
o	Add a small animated element (chart, card, or header).
•	/posts → Posts Page
o	Fetch posts from: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.
o	Display them in reusable Card components.
o	Use your custom hook (e.g., useFetch) to handle the API call.
o	Each post card should link to a dynamic route: /posts/[id].
o	/posts/[id] → Fetch and display details of that single post.
•	/users → Users Page
o	Fetch users from: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
o	Show them in a responsive table with name, email, and company.
o	On row click → open a modal with user details (animated with Framer Motion).
________________________________________
3. Reusability
•	Create at least one reusable Card component.
•	Create at least one custom hook (e.g., useFetch).
________________________________________
4. Animations (Framer Motion)
You must implement at least one meaningful animation (not just a fade). Examples:
•	✅ Animated Sidebar → collapsible sidebar with smooth transitions.
•	✅ Staggered Card Animations → posts/cards stagger in one by one.
•	✅ Animated Modal → user details modal scales/opacity in & out.
👉 You can choose your animation, but it must involve state changes, transitions, and logic.
________________________________________
5. Error Handling & Loading
•	Show a loading state while fetching.
•	Implement error handling for API calls.
•	You must also demonstrate an intentional error case — for example:
o	Temporarily fetch from an invalid endpoint (e.g., /invalid-posts), OR
o	Provide a button that simulates a failed request.
•	When an error occurs, display a clear error message in the UI (e.g., “Failed to load posts”).
________________________________________
6. Deployment & Submission
•	Push code to GitHub (with clear commit history).
•	Deploy the project to Vercel OR any other hosting platform (Netlify, Render, etc.).
•	Submit:
1.	GitHub Repo Link
2.	Live Project Link (Vercel, Netlify, Render, or other).
________________________________________
7. 🔑 Bonus (Optional)
If you want to stand out, implement basic authentication using Auth.js (NextAuth).
•	Example: Add Google login and a protected /profile page that shows user details.
•	This is optional, but completing it will be considered a strong plus.
________________________________________
⏰ Timeline
•	You have 3 days from the time you receive this test.
•	Late submissions will not be considered.
________________________________________
📌 Evaluation Criteria
We will evaluate based on:
•	✅ Code structure and cleanliness
•	✅ Reusability (components, hooks)
•	✅ Proper use of Tailwind CSS
•	✅ Quality of animation with Framer Motion
•	✅ Error handling + intentional error demo
•	✅ GitHub commit discipline
•	✅ Successful deployment (Vercel/Netlify/Render/etc.)
•	⭐ Bonus: Auth.js authentication (if implemented)
•	🎯 Focus is on UI/UX, structure, and reusability — not algorithms

👉 Good luck! We are looking for fast, disciplined, and passionate developers who can own their work and grow with Zettabyte Technology Inc..
